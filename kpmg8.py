# Section A
# 1.Read the file 'jabberwocky.txt' and print its content to the screen
# f = open("jabberwocky.txt", "r")
# print(f.read())

# 2.Read the file 'austen.txt' and print the amount of lines in the file
# z = open("austen.txt", "r")
# lines = 0

# for amount in z:
#   lines += 1

# print("There are " + str(lines) + " lines in this file.")

# 3.Each line of the file 'numbers.txt' contains a number, write a script to add up all the values in the file
# n = open("numbers.txt", "r")

# sum = 0
# for amount in n:
#   amount = int(amount)

# print(sum)

# Section B

# 1.Ask the user to enter their name and append this to a file called register.txt
# f = open("register.txt", "a")

# name = True

# while name:
#     name = input("Enter a name: \n")
#     f.write(name + "\n")
# f.close()

# 2.Create a new file called 'even.txt' that contains only the even numbers from the file 'numbers.txt'
# even = open("even.txt", "w")

# for x in open("numbers.txt", "r"): 
#   x = int(x)
#   if x % 2 == 0:

# even.close()

# 3.'secret.txt' contains a secret message. Each number represents the letter of the alphabet where 1 = A, 2 = B ... Z = 26. Work out what the secret message says

# 4. Benfordâ€™s law states that the leading digits in a collection of data are probably going to be small. For example, most numbers in a set (about 30%) will have a leading digit of 1, when the expected probability is 11.1% (i.e. one out of nine digits). Fake data is usually evenly distributed, where as real data The files 'accounts_1.txt', 'accounts_2.txt' and 'accounts_3.txt' contain financial transaction data. Work out which of the files contains fake data.
